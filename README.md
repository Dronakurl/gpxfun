# ðŸš² Bike Route Analyzer 
## What's the fastest way from A to B?
An app to analyze routes in gpx format to identify the most common starting and end points and analyze:
- duration of each routes
- speed 
- "Crow Speed", i.e. the crow distance divided by time

... across:
- common start/end-point combinations (called "startendcluster" in the app) 
- common routes for these combinations (called "clusters" in the app)
- temperature
- weekday
- season
- time of the day

The app is currently only tested with `gpx` files, recorded and downloaded from [https://www.bikecitizens.net/de/](bikecitizens.net), a wonderful app with easy recording functionality.
